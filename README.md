# SIFT Processor
This is a Python application for performing Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) on images. The application utilizes the PyQt5 library for the GUI interface and OpenCV for image processing tasks.
## Overview
This script implements various functions and methods for processing images using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. The SIFT algorithm is commonly used for feature detection, description, and matching in computer vision tasks.
